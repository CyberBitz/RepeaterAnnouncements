# RepeaterAnnouncements
 
Overview:
Add a repeater announcement engine if your controller does not have one. This script runs on a linux computer (Le Potato/Rasberry Pi) and we use it with a seperate radio $20 low power Boefeng using VOX, but cen be wired in to the repeater with some extra configuration. 

Example Schedule via Cron:
```
#Welcome - between 6am and 8pm every two hours
0 6-20/2 * * * /root/Announcements.py /root/WelcomeMessage.wav 30 0

#Net Invite - every day 3:15pm
15 15 * * * /root/Announcements.py /root/Net\ Invite.wav 30 0

#Net Tonight - Wednesday at 3pm
0 15 * * 3 /root/Announcements.py /root/NetTonight.wav 20 0
```

Use any of the AI text to speach to create a realistic voice for your message.
